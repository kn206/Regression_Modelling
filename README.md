Regression Modelling and Analysis

Regression modeling is a statistical approach used to examine the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. It seeks to understand how changes in the independent variables affect the dependent variable. The main goal of regression modeling is to create a mathematical model that represents this relationship and can be used to predict or explain the values of the dependent variable based on the values of the independent variables.
